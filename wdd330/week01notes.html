    <h1>Remembering User Info</h1>
    <h2>Computers are stupid</h2>
    <p>LocalStorage works with any kind of data. Step 01 is to create the HTML document where the user will save their
        data. Then in javascript, select the place where the user puts in the data and store it in a variable.</p>
    <h2>
        Three functions:
    </h2>
    <p>
        1. Edit <br>
        2. Save <br>
        3. Display <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        The story can be edited through "localStorage. getItem (storyName)". The story is saved with the name of the
        author is named "localStorage. setItem (storyName, storyHTML)". Finally, to display HTML as
        "document. getElementById (“story_display”). innerHTML = storyHTML". 
    </p>
    <p>questions: <br>
        1. how long will this realistically save for? <br>
        2. how could the user save their html as a pdf document? <br>
        3. could local storage become a security risk? <br>
    </p>
